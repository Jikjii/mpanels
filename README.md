## Main Concept

#### In this project, I'd like to create an app for other manga lovers. This app will allow users to log in and have basic CRUD functionalities such as querying through panels both of others in the community and their own, creating a new panel and showing off some of their favorite panels from any manga, and editing and deleting panels at their need.
